# udacity-classic-arcade-game


This is the classic arcade game for my udacity project

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

#MOVES
The player can move left, right, up and down

#POINTS
Moving up the game and getting to the water (i.e. the top of the game board) gets you 50 points.

#ENEMIES
The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board, once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square. you have 5 lives and you have to make the best out of it.

#WIN
Once the player reaches the water (i.e. the top of the game board) 15 times, the game is won.
